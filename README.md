# C++ integrated Shading Language

CSL is a C++ header-only library, self-transpiling into GLSL. It allows to write OpenGL shaders directly inside computer graphics applications code. The concept is that shader correctness is checked at compile-time by the C++ compiler, while a string corresponding to the GLSL code is produced at run-time by the graphic application. CSL can be considered as some kind of inlined GLSL compiler, meaning that if the shader should not compile, the application should not compile either. This project goals are to provide convenient and maintainable shader writing thanks to :

+ Having a syntax as close as possible to GLSL.
+ Having the shader code directly in the C++ code.
+ Checking GLSL specification compliance at C++ compile-time as much as possible.
+ The possibility to use C++ as meta language for generic shader generation.

CSL requires a C++14 compliant compiler. It built successfully using Visual Studio (Windows), Clang (Windows, Linux, Apple), and GCC (Linux, Apple).
CSL does not require any external dependency as it relies only on the C++ Standard Library and some [Boost Preprocessor files](https://github.com/thonatt/CSL/blob/master/src/boost/headers_used.txt) which are included in the repo.

This repo contains the [CSL source files](https://github.com/thonatt/CSL/tree/master/src/csl). It also contains a [shader suite application](https://github.com/thonatt/CSL/tree/master/src/shader_suite/), which shows several CSL shaders, from didactic examples to more complex shaders such as [Dolphin's ubershaders](https://github.com/thonatt/CSL/blob/master/src/shader_suite/shaders/dolphin.cpp). The application can be built using for example CMake.

CSL is a template-heavy library and compilation is currently noticeably slow. The run-time shader generation is however pretty fast. The whole shader suite, including all the examples present in this readme, takes approximately 5 ms to be generated. 

**Disclaimer** : This project is a work in progress. While there is already a lot to play with, the current coverage of the different GLSL specifications is only partial. Many functions or language features are missing. The [syntax section](#csl-syntax) gives a nice preview of what is currently available. The goal is to first make possible what is legal in GLSL. In a second time, the goal will be to make impossible what is not valid in GLSL. 

# Setup

As CSL is a header-only library, a simple include of the file `<csl/core.hpp>` is enough to use it. Here is a small program, showing a vertex shader example and its corresponding output. CSL syntax is described in more detail in the [syntax section](#csl-syntax).

# Credits

Developped by [Th√©o Thonat](https://github.com/thonatt), initially from shader writing induced frustration, but in the end mostly to learn advanced template programming and explore C++ dark corners.

Special thanks to [Simon Rodriguez](https://github.com/kosua20) for decisive and positive feedback about the project initial concept, the help with compilers cross-checking, and for many of the shaders examples.

# CSL syntax

As GLSL and C++ share a common C base language, their syntax are quite similar. However, the goal of CSL is to write C++ code that can perform introspection, while keeping a syntax close to GLSL, meaning that some tradeoffs had to be made. This section covers the subtleties of the CSL syntax (hopefully nothing too repulsive !). It is also a summary of what is possible in CSL:

+ [Setup a shader](#shader-setup)
+ [Basic and Sampler types](#basic-and-sampler-types)
+ [Naming variables](#naming-variables)
+ [Operators and Swizzles](#operators-and-swizzles)
+ [Qualifiers and shader stage options](#qualifiers-and-shader-stage-options)
+ [Arrays and Functions](#arrays-and-functions)
+ [Building blocks](#building-blocks)
+ [Structs and Interface blocks](#structs-and-interface-blocks)
+ [Generic shader generation](#generic-shader-generation)

## Shader setup

Shader type and GLSL version are setup using a specific namespace. For example, `using namespace csl::vert_330` gives access to the built-in functions and built-in variables for a vertex shader with GLSL 3.30. Vertex, fragment, geometry, and tesselation shaders are currently supported. A [shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) namespace is also available.

Starting a new shader requires to create a variable of type `Shader`. This type contains two important member functions. The first one is `Shader::main` which allows to setup the main using a lambda function with no argument that returns nothing. The second one is `Shader::str`, which retrieves the `std::string` associated to the shader that can later be sent to the GPU. See the [previous section](#setup) for an example.

CSL assumes instructions are called sequentially so it is not thread-safe.

## Basic and Sampler types

CSL defines the types used in GLSL. Most CSL types have the exact same typename as their GLSL counterpart. For example, `void`, `vec3`, `ivec2`, `dmat4`, `mat4x3`, `sampler2DArray`, `uimageCube` are all valid types that can be used as is. The only exceptions are `double`, `float`, `int` and `bool` as they would conflict with C++ keywords. Valid associated CSL typenames are `Double`, `Float`, `Int`, `Bool` - and `Uint` to keep the consistency.

Constructors and declarations are identical to GLSL. CSL and C++ basic types can also be mixed.

	bvec3 m = bvec3(true, false, false);
```
</td> 
  </tr>
</table>
</details>

## Naming variables

Because C++ objects do not have names at runtime, it is not possible to directly forward the CSL variable names to the GLSL output. As a consequence, CSL will perfom automatic variable naming, which has a significant impact on the output shader readability.

<details>
    <summary>Automatic naming example</summary>

  <tr>

    <th>Actual output</th> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
        
  ```cpp
In<vec3> normal;
In<vec3> position;
Uniform<vec3> eye;

shader.main([&] {
    Float alpha = 1.2;
    vec3 V = normalize(eye - position);
    vec3 N = normalize(normal);

    Float result;
    result = alpha * dot(N, V);
});
```
</td>
    <td>
  
```cpp
   in vec3 v0;
   in vec3 v1;
   uniform vec3 v2;

   void main() {
      float x0 = 1.2;
      vec3 v4 = normalize(v2 - v1);
      vec3 v5 = normalize(v0);
      float x1;
      x1 = x0*dot(v5, v4);
   }

```
</td> 
  </tr>
</table>
</details>

Therefore, it is possible to provide a name to any CSL variable. It can be done either when declaring a variable using the `(const std::string&)` constructor, or when initializing a variable using the `<<(const std::string&)` operator. Manual naming is rather cumbersome, but may be useful for certain cases such as:
+ Access to uniforms location with an explicit name.
+ Name consistency between vertex out and fragment in variables.
+ Output shader readability for debugging purposes.

    //naming during variable initialisation
    Float alpha = Float(1.2) << "alpha";
    vec3 V = eye - position << "V";
    vec3 N = normalize(normal) << "N";

    //naming during variable declaration
    Float result("result");
    result = alpha * dot(N, V);
});

  float alpha = 1.2;
  vec3 V = eye - position;
  vec3 N = normalize(normal);
  float result;
  result = alpha*dot(N, V);
}
```
</td> 
  </tr>
</table>
</details>

## Operators and Swizzles

As C++ and GLSL share a common C base syntax, most of the operators keywords are identical and can be used as is. This includes for example:
+ `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` and their assignment operator counterparts,
+ `==`, `<`, `>` , `&&` and other binary relational or bitwise operators,
+ `[]` for component or row access, and for swizzling.

One exception is the ternary operator ` ? : `. Even if the synthax is similar between C++ and GLSL, it cannot be overloaded. Therefore it is replaced by a macro `CSL_TERNARY` with the 3 arguments.

Swizzles are GLSL-specific operators for verstatile vector components acces. In order to preserve all the swizzling possibilities while keeping the code simple, CSL uses global variables such as `x`, `y`, `z`, or `w`. The syntax for swizzle accessing is for example `myVec[x,z,x]`. To prevent namespace pollution, all those swizzle variables belong to a specific namespace corresponding to their swizzle set. Available namespaces are `csl::swizzles::xyzw`, `csl::swizzles::rgba`, `csl::swizzles::stpq`, and `csl::swizzles::all` which includes the previous three.

//can you guess what is actually assigned ?

  </tr>

</details>

## Qualifiers and shader stage options

Memory qualifiers are available in CSL in the form of template classes. Their template parameters are the underlying type and an optional `Layout`, which is itself a template class. Available memory qualifiers are `In`, `Out`, `Inout`, and `Uniform`. Layout qualifiers are classes, which may be templated over an unsigned int when it requires a value. CSL layout qualifiers are identical to GLSL, except for beginning with an uppercase.

## Arrays and Functions

Arrays in CSL are a template class similar to `std::array`, with parameters the internal type and the size. Unspecified or zero size are used for implicitely sized GLSL arrays. Indexing is done with the usual `[]` operator. Multi dimensional arrays are supported as nested arrays.

Functions in CSL are objects that can be created using the `declareFunc` template function with a C++ lambda as parameter. The return type must be explicitely specified as template parameter. Returns are declared using the `CSL_RETURN;` or `CSL_RETURN(expression);` syntax. Parameters can be named using default argument values. The function can be called later in the code using the usual `()` operator. Function overloading is possible in CSL by providing multiple return types and lambdas.

## Building blocks

Selection, iteration and jump statements are available in CSL. As C++ and GLSL share the same keywords, CSL redefines them using macros with the syntax `CSL_KEYWORD`, namely `CSL_FOR`, `CSL_CONTINUE`, `CSL_BREAK`, `CSL_WHILE`, `CSL_IF`, `CSL_ELSE`, `CSL_ELSE_IF`, `CSL_SWITCH`, `CSL_CASE`, and `CSL_DEFAULT`. Their behavior is mostly identical to C++ and GLSL. Here are some comments and a few limitations:
+ A `CSL_SWITCH` **must** contain a `CSL_DEFAULT` case, even if it happens to be empty.
+ CSL syntax for `case value :` is `CSL_CASE(value) :`.
+ Condition and loop in `CSL_FOR( init-expression; condition-expression; loop-expression)` must not contain more than one statement each. There is no limit about the number of initialisation in the init-expression. Any of these expressions can also be empty.
+ Variables declared in `CSL_FOR` args expressions outlive the scope of the `for` body. It is possible to prevent that by putting explicitly the whole for in a scope.
+ Statements can be nested

## Structs and Interface blocks

CSL structs are declared using the syntax `CSL_STRUCT(StructTypename, member-list ...);`. As members in C++ have no way to know if they belong to a struct, CSL has to use some form of reflection, based on C++ preprocessor magic. So to help the preprocessor looping over the members, `member-list` has to be declared using *typed expressions*, which look like this: `(Type1) member1, (Type2) member2, ...`

Interface block are similar to structs with syntax `CSL_INTERFACE_BLOCK(Qualifier, Typename, Name, ArraySize, member-list ... );`. `Name` and `ArraySize` can be empty. `Qualifier` refers to the memory and layout qualifiers associated to the block. The syntax is identical to single variables except there is no need to specify the type. `Name` is name of the variable associated to the block. In case it is empty, it declares an unnamed interface block and the members belong directly to the current scope. If not empty, `ArraySize` refers to the size of the declared array. Again, a size of 0 is used to declare an implicitely sized array.

Since the `member-list` is parsed by the preprocessor, **members typename must not contain any comma**. To circumvent this issue, type aliases must be created. In the case of arrays, the type helper `csl::Array<T>::Size<N>` can be used as an alias for `csl::Array<T,N>`.

Since CSL must rely on a macro for structs and interface blocks, it means it can directly forward the members names (and interface block variable names). Therefore there is no need for either automatic or manual naming in those cases. 

## Generic shader generation

Regular C++ workflow can be used to help the generation of CSL shaders, such as changing values (including arrays size), manual unrolling or conditionnal expressions. The helper `csl::ConstExpr<Type, value>` can be used to pass `constexpr` parameters, which are useful for example to specify the size of an array. 

The use of C++ as a meta-languages for CSL has limitations. For example, CSL scopes are still C++ scopes under the hood, so CSL declarations do not outlive C++ scopes.
