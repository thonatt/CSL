# C++ integrated Shading Language

CSL is a C++ header-only library for writing OpenGL shaders directly inside computer graphics applications code. 

+ Synthax as close as possible to GLSL
+ Most of the GLSL specification compliance is checked at compile-time
+ Having all the code in one place
+ C++ as meta language for more versatile shader generation

Using tools from the C++ coding environement such as intelligent code-completion from dedicated IDEs or compile-time  GLSL specificationsynthax checks, CSL allows fast and correct shader writing.
Code in one place. It also makes possible to use C++ as meta language for more versatile shader generation.

Compliance with respect to the GLSL specification .
This project aims to keep the synthax as close as possible to GLSL.
